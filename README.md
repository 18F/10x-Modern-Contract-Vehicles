# 10x-Modern-Contract-Vehicles
18F project to understand how our team can better support colleagues, partners, and vendors in the procurement of agile development and human-centered design services.

## Why we’re here
This is a Phase Two continuation of Modern Contract Vehicles, with the goal of identifying how TTS can better support colleagues, partners, and vendors in the procurement of agile development and human-centered design services.
 
The Agile BPA began as three different vendor pools, one for full stack development that was ultimately awarded; one for development skills as a small business set aside and one for design, both of which did not make it through to award. With the pool that was ultimately awarded, there were a few core issues: time to award, competition, user research resources, and onboarding and offboarding vendors. Out of our 10 orders in two years, the average amount of bids was 6. We saw a steady decline in competition as well. The first few task orders (FedRAMP marketplace, eQIP, 14(c)) all received high amount of bids, 7-14. Our most recent task orders (Christmas tree permitting and the second 14(c) project) saw only 2 and 5 bids respectively. Without adequate competition amongst the vendors on the BPA, 18F was no longer confident that we were getting the strongest vendors for our agency partners. This is detailed publicly in our blog post.
 
Phase One focused internally on TTS Acquisition and evaluated whether the Agile BPA was helping TTS achieve our business goals and improve outcomes for our partner agencies. The research showed that the Agile BPA does not necessarily improve our ability to evaluate and contract high quality professional services in the areas of agile software development and human-centered design. 
 
While the findings were inconclusive about the value of vendor pools, it surfaced two broader/adjacent questions requiring further investigation:
 
1. How do we identify high-quality vendors for agile development and HCD and ensure that they respond to our solicitations?
2. What requirements, criteria, and evaluation methods are most effective in selecting vendors who can deliver working software on time, on budget, and in alignment with agile, open, and user-centered practices?
 
These questions are the focus of Phase Two. The project team will broaden its research to include external agency partners, acquisition experts, and vendors. 
 
The project team will document and share learnings and results from various vendor evaluation and modular contracting mechanisms that have been tried across government (vendor pools, public Github repos, verbal interviews, etc). Findings and recommendations may be further tested with prototypes to improve how federal agencies hire private vendors to build products and services using agile development techniques.


## Research Questions

1. What requirements, criteria, and evaluation methods are most effective in selecting vendors who can deliver working software on time, on budget, and in alignment with agile, open, and user-centered practices?
* Are expected capabilities/skills for these disciplines clearly defined? Are partners familiar with them, and/or existing resources?
* What vendor evaluation methods have been successful for identifying contractors who have strong human-centered design capabilities?
* What vendor evaluation methods have been successful for identifying contractors who can successfully use open practices?
* What vendor evaluation methods do stakeholders feel frustrated by? Or seem ineffective for evaluating specific skills?
* How confident do partners feel in their ability to evaluate vendors through various methods? What would help them do this better?

2. How do we identify high-quality vendors for agile development and HCD and ensure that they respond to our solicitations?
* Can vendor pools help deliver software in an agile way across government?
* What vendor pools currently exist for agile delivery services? Are they operating similarly? Any standouts that warrant deeper exploration?
* Are there any vendor pools currently focused on a targeted/niche discipline? Which disciplines?
* Do experiences with targeted/niche pools vary by discipline? 
* Which specific niche skill sets, common to many of our partners’ projects, are most difficult to source? Why? Which skills are easiest to source?
* Does contracting off of vendor pools have an impact on project timelines? Administrative burden?
* How do outcomes for projects contracted off of pools compare to open solicitations? Does a targeted/niche vendor pool improve project outcomes? 
* How often is market research done prior to solicitation? How is this research done among project teams and within contracting shops?
* What other methods / mechanisms are COs and Project Teams using to identify potential vendors and get quality responses to solicitations? Which have returned higher numbers of quality responses? What are they doing differently than traditional contracting process?
